# PyEReindexer-ELK
Reindex is the concept of copying existing data from a source index to a destination index which can be inside the same or a different cluster. Elasticsearch has a dedicated endpoint _reindex for this purpose. A reindexing is mostly required for updating mapping or settings.
This is a Python project for automating the Reindexing process in ElasticSearch. Using this code, you can transfer all data from one ElasticSearch cluster to a new ElasticSearch cluster.
